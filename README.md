# Learning to Grasp: A Deep Learning Approach to Generalized Robust Grasp Affordance

## Getting started

After clonning this repository run `git submodule init && git submodule update`
to download the ggcnn dependency.

Next run make {cpu|gpu} depending on wether you have a dedicated graphics card
compatible with tensorflow or not.

To test that the project is properly setup you can run `make test`. All tests
should be passing.
